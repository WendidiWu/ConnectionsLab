    <h1> Introverted Fireworks </h1>
    <h2> Interactive Installation | Arduino | Time-of-Flight Sensor </h2>
    <p> <em>Introverted Fireworks is an interactive art installation that empowers the audience with the magic to
            control the fireworks.
        </em></p>

    <p> The Introverted Fireworks will come to life as soon as the audience engages with it. Participants are invited to
        place their hand about 1 inch above<br>
        the sensor and move it up and down. The fireworks will illuminate in response to the height of the hand,
        creating a dynamic visual display. </p>

    <p>My inspiration for this project came from the Time-of-Flight sensor itself. The first time I witnessed its
        workings, it felt like I was encountering a piece <br> of magic. This sense of wonder sparked my desire to
        create an experience that feels just as magical. </p>
    <p>Fireworks came to mind as the subject for this installation because they embody the fleeting beauty we can never
        truly capture or preserve. They burst <br> into life, dazzling us for a brief moment before fading away, leaving
        only a memory. With this installation, I wanted to offer the audience not just the<br> chance to witness
        fireworks, but to possess the magic power to play with them, to hold that ephemeral beauty in their handsâ€”even
        if only for a moment.</p>
    <p>However, this magic power comes with a cost. To preserve the beauty of the fireworks, the audience must remain
        engaged, continuously interacting with <br> the sensor. The moment they pull away, the magic vanishes, and the
        fireworks disappear, reminding us of the transient nature of beauty and the effort <br> required to sustain it.
